## Main Features

### MDX

The list of projects and blog posts is obtained from a remote repository through the GitHub API.

### Modals

Clicking on a project or blog post opens a modal using [Intercepting Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/intercepting-routes) with [Parallel Routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/parallel-routes) to display the content over the current page.

### Localization

The page supports English and Spanish, changing all content and data obtained from external sources, such as the database and MDX files.

Therefore, there are two versions of each remote MDX, and columns based on the current language in the database.

### Admin

The Administrator route, along with all subroutes, is protected with credentials, saved in the database. The password has been encrypted using bcrypt.

The datatable allows filtering and sorting, with edit and delete buttons for the column, and a create button at the top. All actions use Server Actions.

The forms use react-hook-form and Zod for validation on both the frontend and backend.
